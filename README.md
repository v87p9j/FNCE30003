Part I. Currency Carry Trade (45 marks)
All the questions and requirements are underlined with bold fonts.
In this exercise, we take a look at the currency carry trade. In the assignment Excel file:
●   Sheet “Part IA” includes the end of month exchange rate USD/AUD and JPY/USD.
●   Sheet “Part IB” includes the monthly interest rates for USA, Japan and Australia.
●   The data period is 30-Jan-2010 to 30-Jul-2024.
●   Note: To be consistent, we will use the quote 1AUD = xUSD, 1USD = yJPY, and 1AUD = zJPY, in answers to all the questions in this part.
1. Report the mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and maximum and minimum of monthly percentage change of the BID exchange rates between USD and AUD, JPY and USD. (5 marks)
2. Report the mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis and maximum and minimum of the interest rate differences between JPY and USD, and between USD and AUD. (5 marks)
3.  Plot the time-series of percentage changes of USD-JPY exchange rate and interest rate difference between JPY and USD, all in per annum terms.
Then in another graph do the same for AUD and USD. (10 marks) You may find a similar graph in the lecture on AUD and JPY relation.
4.   To explore whether currency carry trade is profitable, we use the following  strategy acting as a Japanese investor to consider AUD and JPY carry trade:
i). at the end of each month t, we borrow 1 million JPYs, convert to AUD straight away, then invest the money for month t+1;
ii). then convert back to JPY at the end of each month t+1.
Starting with the given data, describe the steps and formula you use in the calculation (backed up by your excel spreadsheet). Report the average monthly profits or losses and the standard deviation. (20 marks)
5代 写FNCE30003 International Finance 2024 Semester 2Prolog
代做程序编程语言.   At the beginning of 2019, suppose you just started your carry trade business.
You started replicating the same process as described in Question 4 for the full 2019 calendar year. Report your average monthly profits or losses from your first year in carry trade. Regardless of your first year results, you wanted to keep trading for the full 2020 calendar year. Report your average monthly results for 2020. Is there any difference from these two years’ results? Comment on what potentially would cause the difference. (5 marks)
Note: Question 5 is an open question. The word limit is stickily no more than 100 .
Part II. US-China Geopolitical/Geo-economic Fragmentation (25 marks)
After decades of increasing global economic integration, the world is facing the risk of fragmentation. Increasing political tensions, physical, and regulatory barriers on   international trade are accelerating the fragmentation of the world's economy. Geopolitical fragmentation refers to the increasing divisions and tensions among nations along geopolitical lines, which are straining international relations and impacting global trade flows (Aiyar et al., 2023; Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2024). The US-China conflict is a quintessential example of geopolitical fragmentation. The ongoing rivalry between the US and China began in 2018, in which the United States accused China of unfair trade practices and imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, to which China retaliated with counter-tariffs (Son, 2022).
The conflict in the US-China trade relationship resulted in immediate economic shocks, significantly disrupting global supply chains, particularly in industries heavily reliant on cross-border trade, such as technology and manufacturing. Bown (2020) reports the tariffs led to a decline in US-China bilateral trade, with a 15% decrease in imports from China to the US in 2019 alone compared to the previous year. This disruption forced companies to reconfigure their supply chains, often at substantial cost, leading to increased prices for consumers and decreased profit margins for businesses (Campos et al., 2023).
Though the economic consequences of geopolitical fragmentation are profound and multifaceted, littler explanation has been offered for the potential causes to the US-China conflict in the first place. In his recent speech at the National Press Club of Australia, Yanis Varoufakis shed some light on the causes. After watching his speech his speech via the weblink, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AI8RG6nMGg, you  are asked to answer the following questions.
1.   What is (are) the explanation(s) offered by Yanis as the cause(s) of the US- China conflict; (The word limit is stickily no more than 100) (10 marks)
2.   With further supporting evidence, state whether you agree or disagree with
Yanis explanation(s) discussed in question 1. (The word limit is 300,with the ±10% word limit leeway.) (15 marks)Note: Part II is an open question. There is no specific right or wrong answer. Your marks  depend on your analysis and/or how well you will apply your learnings obtained from the course.
Part III. PPP Study Using Specific Commodities (30)
All the questions and requirements are underlined with bold fonts.
1. We start with the Big Mac index. Sheet “Part III” in the Excel file includes the latest releasedata for the Big Mac index recorded on 1 January, 2024. For this assignment, we are particularly interested in the following regions:
●   Australia
●   Brazil
●   Canada
●   Hong Kong
●    India
●   Philippines
●   Singapore
●   UAE
●   UK
●   USA
Use the data, write down the local price, market exchange rate vs. USD, PPP
implied exchange rate vs. USD, and relative difference (in percentages) between the two exchange rates. (5 marks).
2. For comparison, we will also look at the same results using the iPhone. You can check 256G iPhone 15 outright prices across different regions from Apple’s website: http://www.apple.com/choose-your-country/. For the same regions listed above, write down the local prices, PPP implied exchange rate vs. USD, and relative difference (in percentages) between the two exchange rates. (10 mark)
Note: You can use the same market exchange rate as above, since Apple’sprice do not change that often.
3. Compare the results for Big Mac and iPhone and briefly discuss the differences. (15 marks)
Note: The word limit of this question (Question 3) is 150, with the ±10% word limit leeway.
